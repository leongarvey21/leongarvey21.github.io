                     Here are some of my flyer creations that i have created for youtube/twitch streamers online. These are to showcase upcoming streams/events which will potentially increase 
                     live viewers and audience.

The process of making these flyers has came naturally to me over the time creating them.
I always start with the theme in mind then combine background images and foreground images using colour correction techniques.

To do my sort of style, I like to use alot of soft brushes to make the skin look smooth and detailed. I can also use low flow brushes to add shadows and highlights to the face and body.

<br><br>

One main key in my process is using alot of linked layers, this allows me to edit the image without destroying the original image. I can then use the linked layer to add effects and colour correction to the image.
I also use a lot of blending modes to make the images fit together, such as soft light, overlay, multiply and screen. This allows me to create a more realistic look and feel to the image.
Camera Raw Filter works wonders for me, I use this at the start to soften the skin of the characters. For the final touches, 
I then use Camera Raw Filter again to add saturation, contrast and brightness to the image.

For the first flyer, I was given two images to put into a flyer (Both of the guys). I put these images into the fly and built around them. The theme was "Rap" and they were based in detroit. Therefore, I added detroit city in the background, added fire on buildings. Shaded each guy using low flow brushes and softened skin using raw filter tool.
Added a gradient in the background to replicate a dark sky, added in clouds with cloud brush and stars using a picture of a galaxy then turned it to soft light/overlay mode.
Lastly, I added a brick wall with fire coming around it and big text in the foreground of the image.<br><br>


    This is personally my favourite flyer I have made, I worked closely with the streamer to get the look he wanted. The theme was "War" and the event was a Song Wars where individuals would play a song and battle for the best song.
     I added in a war background to fit the vibe. I also had to somehow fit 12 people into one image which i think i did pretty well and clean looking. I had to individually edit each person and shade/detail them. For the main part (The Stage) I have a stone wall to fit the 
     war theme. I put the text on the wall so its there infront of you, along with a spotlight on top coming from a helicopter to give it a more dramatic look but also keep the focus on the middle of the image.
     I then added smoke to finish the look using smoke brushes.

    For the Men In Black flyer, Its a full on take of the original Men In Black movie poster. Utilising Photo Compositing and Colour correction i was able to create a clean look. Created from scratch,
     Everything you see was put in by me, even the credits text, each credit relates to their production behind the scenes and streaming friends.<br><br>


    The second poster is for "Melly Mike" who is a twitch streamer and rapper, i used a photo of him and a picture of Goku (DragonBallZ) and colour corrected both images to match the same. 
    I added lightning using brushes and added necessary shadowing and lighting to the cutouts using
    low flow brushes making it fit more naturally into the background. I searched online through DaFont and found a dragonballZ font which helped me complete the look.

    "Mikeyyy!" Is one of my recurring customers on Fiverr, This is one of my favourite posters i made for him. He sent me over a image of himself and I put it into photoshop and made this. Used fog brushes and regular soft brushes in photoshop. 
    Did heavy shading and detail on his face / clothing.<br><br>


    This is not a commissioned piece, I made it for fun as I like Ken Carson's music. This is a very high detail poster; each part is composited and shaded. 
    The alleyway is a cut-out picture, and I detailed each brick on the walls and lighting on the floor/walls. I added a bat into his hand, added blood too. I then added a car on fire behind him, it was just a PNG of a rusty car and then i added fire effects on top
    using good colour correction techniques. Then after i added the fire, since there was new lighting i had to add the fire lighting to the back of his body and walls of the alleyway.
    I also made the moon, overlayed white brushes to make it glow. Added a gradient background for the night sky and added clouds and stars using brushes. Overall one of my best posters i made.

<h2 class="large-spacer hidden">process</h2>






              <p class="hidden">
Working closely with Carrie helped me refine her initial idea into a finished product. 
She provided me with a rough template and some key elements she wanted included, such as 
her brand name, imagery, and contact details. From there, I focused on creating a design 
that felt professional but still carried the personal, handmade quality of her business.
                   
                </p>

<p class="hidden">
                During the process, I experimented with typography, layout, and 
                colour choices. I kept the fonts clear and readable while adding 
                small stylistic details to give the vouchers a polished look. I also 
                worked with the images she suggested — such as scissors, thread, and a 
                sewing machine — and explored how they could be integrated meaningfully.
                 One detail I particularly liked was using the scissors handle as part of
                  the lettering, tying the imagery and branding together in a subtle way.

             <p class="hidden">
Once the main layout was finalized, I refined the design for print.
 This meant adjusting alignment, spacing, and sizing so the vouchers would be consistent 
 across different formats. I kept the overall style simple, practical, and easy to reproduce 
 while ensuring it reflected Carrie’s vision. The result was a design that not only looked
  professional but also captured the essence of her brand.

                <h2 class="large-spacer hidden">Final Look</h2>
                
                
        
         <p class="hidden">
Carrie was very pleased with the outcome of the final product, 
as it combined both functionality and a unique sense of identity 
for her brand. One of the strongest aspects of the design was the 
creation of a custom logo, developed from an image she provided. By 
carefully integrating the scissors into the typography, I was able to 
transform the handle into the letter C, while the other handle naturally
 fit into the E. This subtle yet clever design decision ensured that 
 the branding felt personal, memorable, and closely tied to her craft.
      </p>

      <p class="hidden">
In addition to the logo, the overall layout of the voucher was designed to remain clean and professional, while still carrying a handmade feel that reflects Carrie’s work. I chose a simple colour palette, clear typography, and balanced spacing so that the vouchers would not only be visually appealing but also practical for everyday business use. The inclusion of spaces for details such as number, date, and value was deliberate, making the voucher easy to fill out and reuse consistently.
      </p>

      <p class="hidden">
Looking at the completed designs, I feel that the project successfully strikes a balance between creative design and usability. The final product is not just a voucher but also a small extension of Carrie’s brand identity. It showcases her values of craftsmanship, attention to detail, and creativity in a way that her customers can immediately connect with.
      </p>




  <h2 class="large-spacer hidden">Reflection</h2>
                
                
        
         <p class="hidden">
The project was successful in meeting both the client’s needs
and my design goals. Carrie was very pleased with how the final
 vouchers looked and felt, especially the way her brand identity
  was tied together through the custom logo and balanced layout. 
  The vouchers were print-ready and easy for her to distribute,
   giving her business a professional and polished tool to share with customers.
      </p>

      <p class="hidden">
From a design perspective, this project allowed me to practice working 
with client feedback and translating rough ideas into a clean, cohesive
 product. I also learned the importance of balancing decorative elements
  with readability, ensuring the final outcome was both attractive and functional.
      </p>

      <p class="hidden">
Overall, the outcome demonstrates how collaboration and thoughtful design
 choices can elevate a small business’s branding. This project not only 
 strengthened my technical design skills but also reinforced the value of 
 communication and adaptability in delivering a result the client was genuinely
  proud of.
